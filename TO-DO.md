TO-DO project 2 : 

STEP 1 
    - Choosing load demands (Amy & Jet)                         (DONE)
    - Choosing Country                                          (DONE - Sweden)
    - Choosing customers & producers location                   (Remove 3 customers to Ex-1 - DONE)
    - Choosing network topology (size, lenght, type of pipes)   (Topology of Ex-1 - DONE)
    - Research Pipes technical parameters                       (DONE)
    - Modify Pheat max customers + load demand                  (DONE)
    - Research Pipes "investment parameters" + modify files     ()         
    - Why is the optimizer not working ?                        (DONE)

    - Questions :                                               (DONE)
1) Based on the needed capacity, the optimizer chooses the pipe-types which will have a minimum cost to create and operate.

2) DN-30 is more efficient and less expensive but the capacity is much lesser. (add figures)

3) As the pipes near the producers often need to carry the heating capacity of multiple consumers, they are often bigger (DN-50), while the pipes further from the producers often derserve one consumer so the optimizer choose smaller pipes.


STEP 2 
    - New topology (add 5 customers & 3 Producers to STEP 1)    (Max - DONE)
    - Choose 5 more loads                                       (Amey&Jet - DONE)
    - New pipe types (5diff)                                    (All - DONE)
    - Producers types modelisation                              (All)
